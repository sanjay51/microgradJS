# microgradJS

**Typescript Micrograd library based on Andrej Karpathy's micrograd (python)**

All the code is written using the ["The spelled-out intro to neural networks and backpropagation: building micrograd" by Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0)

The original code is written in Python: https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd/tree/master
